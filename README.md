- **Text Data Parsing with Apache Spark**: Leverages Apache Spark for distributed parsing and processing of text data.
- **Time Series Prediction with SARIMA**: Applies SARIMA models to predict trends in news article data over time.
- **LDA and Classifier Model Training with Apache Spark**: Implements Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and classification models for topic modeling and article classification.
- **Parallel Computing Speed Analysis**: Evaluates the performance benefits of parallelization in processing large datasets.

## Abstract
This study explores advanced data processing techniques to analyze a comprehensive dataset of news articles from The Guardian (2020â€“2024), providing insights into recent world events and trends. By employing parallel computing frameworks such as Apache Spark, Hadoop, and Pig Latin, combined with NLP tools and classification models, the project showcases the power of parallelization in handling large-scale text data. Key components include parallel data fetching, distributed text parsing with Apache Spark, time series forecasting using SARIMA, and topic modeling with LDA alongside classifier training. The results demonstrate enhanced scalability, computational efficiency, and the ability to classify unseen data accurately, highlighting the transformative potential of parallel computing in big data analytics and text analysis applications.
